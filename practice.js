//We're in a job interview. Answer the following questions (try to not look at your notes unless you have to).
  // 1) What is the purpose of the 'this keyword'?

  // To avoid redundancy

  // 2) What are the four rules that govern what the 'this keyword' is bound to and describe each?

  // Whenever a function is contained in the global scope, the value of this inside of that function will be the window object.
  // Whenever a function is called by a preceding dot, the object before that dot is this.
  // Whenever a constructor function is used, this refers to the specific instance of the object that is created and returned by the constructor function.
  // Whenever JavaScriptâ€™s call or apply method is used, this is explicitly defined.

  // 3) What is the difference between call and apply?

  // Apply lets you invoke the function with arguments as an array; call requires the parameters be listed explicitly.

  // 4) What does .bind do?

  // Bind creates a new function that will have this set to the first parameter passed to bind().


//Next Problem

//Create an object called user which has the following properties.
  //username --> which is a string
  //email --> which is a string
  //getUsername --> which is a function that returns the current object's username property. *Don't use 'user' instead use the 'this' keyword*

    var user = {
      username: "Fernando",
      email: "random@gmail.com",
      getUsername: function() {
        return this.username;
      }
    };

//Now, invoke the getUsername method and verify you got the username of the object and not anything else.


//Next Problem


// Write a constructor function, including method definitions, which will make the following function invocations function properly.

  this.year = year;
  this.move = 0;
  this.moveCar = function() {
 function Car(brand, model, year) {
  this.brand = brand;
  this.model = model;
    return this.move += 10;
  }
 }

var prius = new Car('Toyota', 'Prius', 2011);
var mustang = new Car('Ford', 'Mustang', 2013);

//Hint, you'll need to add a move property, with a starting value of zero, and write a moveCar function which will increment the move property by 10. The move property will be added to every object that is being returned from the Car function. You'll also need to use the 'this' keyword properly in order to make sure you're invoking moveCar on the right object (prius vs mustang).

prius.moveCar(); //increments prius' move property by 10. Returns the new move property.
mustang.moveCar(); //increments mustang' move property by 10. Returns the new move property.



//Continuation of previous problem

var getYear = function(){
  return this.year;
};

//Above you're given the getYear function. Call the getYear function with the prius then the mustang objects being the focal objects. *Don't add getYear as a property on both objects*.

//Note(no tests)
 getYear(prius, mustang);


//New Problem

var myUser = {
 username: 'iliketurtles',
 age: 13,
 email: 'iliketurtles@gmail.com'
};

var getMyUsername = function() {
 return this.username;
};

var userName = getMyUsername.apply(myUser); //Fix this

//Above you're given an object, and  a function. What will the getMyUsername function return?
//Note(no tests)

  //undefined

//In the example above, what is the 'this keyword' bound to when getMyUsername runs?

  // the window object


//Fix the getMyUsername invocation (stored in the userName variable, at the bottom of the above code) so that userName will be equal to 'iliketurtles'.
